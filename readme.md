### Acknowledgements
Many thanks to Greg Hurrell for his amazing [repository](https://github.com/wincent/wincent) where I took most of the configuration and especially for his [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXPHFM88IlFn68OmLwtPmZA) about Vim!

And, of course, many thanks to the authors of the plugins that make Vim and Neovim so convenient and powerful:
